 C - Functions, nested loops
------------------------------------
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
What are header files and how to to use them with #include

Tasks 0
------------
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

Tasks 1
------------
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Tasks 2
-----------
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Tasks 3
---------------
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise

Tasks 4
--------------
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise

Tasks 5
-------------
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

Tasks 6
-------------
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

Prototype: int _abs(int);

Tasks 7
------------
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
Returns the value of the last digit

Tasks 8
-------------
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

Tasks 9
---------------
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

Prototype: void times_table(void);

Tasks 10
-------------
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: int add(int, int);

Tasks 11
-------------
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in order
The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
The last printed number should be 98
You are allowed to use the standard library
